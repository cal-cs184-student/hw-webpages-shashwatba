		<h2>Overview</h2>
		Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the homework.

		<h2>Part 1: Ray Generation and Scene Intersection</h2>
		<p>To generate camera rays, I looked at the diagram and thought about the transformations that (x, y) goes under (luckily, I didn't need to draw a diagram). Since x and y are in betweeen 0 and 1 initially, we can subtract 0.5 from both of them and multiply by 2 to have them be in the range [-1, 1] instead. Then we can scale them with the width and height of the camera space as per the boundary vertex values in the diagram. Lastly, we multiply by cWd on the left to transform to world coordinates and normalize by dividing with the norm and also set <code>min_t</code> and <code>max_t</code> as indicated in the spec.</p>
		<p>To generate pixel samples, I followed the steps laid out in the spec where I started by generating <code>ns_aa</code> samples using the <code>gridSampler->getSample()</code> method. Then, I mapped these samples to the pixel space by adding the pixel's top-left corner coordinates to the sample offsets and normalizing by the height and width of the space. This ensured that the samples were distributed uniformly within the pixel. Finally, I storedthe running sum of these samples into <code>(x, y)</code> using <code>SampleBuffer.updatePixel</code>.</p>
		<p>My implementation of ray-triangle intersections was the same as the Möller-Trumbore algorithm in the slides. I calculated edges <code>e1</code> and <code>e2</code>, crossproducts <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code> and the difference of the ray origin and triangle vertex <code>s</code>. Then I calculated the (t, b1, b2) vector, which required me to make sure that all values were within [0, 1]. Lastly, in the <code>intersect()</code> function only, I also updated the <code>t, primitive, bsdf and n</code> variables of the <code>isect</code> of the triangle. To calculate <code>n</code>, I dot-producted the normal vector of the triangle with (b1, b2, 1 - b1 - b2).</p>
		<p>For the ray-sphere intersection, I followed the quadratic equation intersection method in the lecture slides. I had to make a few additional checks to ensure that the discriminant was non-negative and that the t values were within the bounds of the sphere. I also had to calculate the normal vector of the sphere at the intersection point in <code>isect</code> by subtracting the center of the sphere from the intersection point and normalizing it.</p>

		<h2>Part 2: Bounding Volume Hierarchy</h2>
		<p>For the BVH construction, I first initialized a <code>BVHNode</code> to be the entire bounding box. Then, if <code>max_leaf_size</code> is less than the number of primitives in the bbox, I make it a leaf node. Otherwise if the node contains more primitives than allowed in a leaf, the algorithm chooses a splitting axis based on the extent of the centroid bounding box.  It selects the axis along which the centroids vary the most, then partitions the primitives using the midpoint of the centroids along that axis. This is done using <code>std::partition</code>, which rearranges the primitives such that those with centroids less than the midpoint go to the left and the rest go to the right. If partitioning fails to split (e.g., all centroids fall on one side), it defaults to a balanced split. Finally, the algorithm recursively constructs the left and right child nodes, resulting in a binary BVH tree optimized for spatial queries./p>

		<p>Rendering times were significantly for these images than without the BVH implementation. For example, Lucy took 1.3 seconds with BVH and 1510.2 seconds without BVH. Dragon took 1.0 seconds with BVH and 1258.9 without. This means the average speedup was around 1335x, wherein the creation time of the BVH is logarithmic alongside the time to traverse it. By avoiding checking unnecessary nodes not in the BVH tree, we save enough time to go from O(n) to O(log(n)) time complexity.</p>
		<h2>Part 3: Direct Illumination</h2>
		<p>I first implemented the <code>f()</code> function in <code>bsdf.cpp</code> where I simply returned <code>reflectance/(2*pi)</code> since our algorithm doesn't depend on the input vectors. Next, in <code>zero_bounce_radiance()</code>, I called the bsdf's <code>get_emission()</code> function.</p>
		<p>For hemisphere lighting, I repeatedly sampled from the bsdf using <code>sample_f()</code> <code>num_samples</code> times. I then account for Lambert's cosine law and compute the cosine theta term between the sample direction and the surface normal (0, 0, 1). Next, I transform the sample into world space coordinates by multiplying with <code>o2w</code>. I keep track of the shadow ray generated in that direction from the surface point. Then, I check for any intersection between the shadow ray and a surface using <code>bvh->intersect</code> and add it as a running sum to <code>L_out</code>, where the light is computed as \( \frac{L * f * cos\theta}{pdf} \). Lastly, we divide by <code>num_samples</code> to produce an average of the samples and return it.</p>
		<p>For importance sampling, the key was realizing that I only need to sample directions which have light sources in them. This time, I perform <code>ns_area_light</code> samples instead for each light in the scene and calling <code>sample_L</code> to sample. Again, I computed the shadow ray from the light source, but made sure to cap it at the distance from the source, or it will overshoot. I then similarly checked for intersection with the BVH, updating the running sum with the same formula. Another thing I did was that I skipped values corresponding to non-positive thetas, as those would be light sources in the wrong direction. Lastly, I averaged the samples as before.</p>

		</div>
		<p>Overall, importance sampling significantly outperforms uniform hemisphere sampling in terms of visual quality and efficiency. Hemisphere sampling sends rays in arbitrary directions, which results in many ineffective samples and leads to high-frequency noise, particularly in scenes with small or occluded light sources. Importance sampling addresses this by directing rays toward known light sources, ensuring most samples are productive. This results in brighter, smoother images with accurate soft shadows, even with fewer samples. The improvement is most notable in less well-lit areas like wall corners where uniform sampling fails to capture the darkness appropriately.</p>
		<h2>Part 4: Global Illumination</h2>
		<p>In contrast to direct lighting, indirect illumination comes from the light bouncing between non-emitting surfaces in the scene. After computing the local coordinate system at the intersection and determining the hit point and outgoing direction, I first added the result of <code>one_bounce_radiance</code> to the final radiance <code>L_out</code>. Then, using Russian Roulette with a survival probability \(q = 0.65\), I probabilistically decided whether to continue bouncing. If the bounce continues, I sampled a new direction <code>i</code> using the BSDF, computed the cosine of that direction with respect to the surface normal, and constructed a new ray pointing in that direction. If the ray successfully intersected another object and the cosine was positive, I recursively called <code>at_least_one_bounce_radiance</code> to get the radiance from that next point. I then scaled the returned light by the BSDF value, cosine term, PDF, and the Russian Roulette weight to keep the estimate unbiased. This allowed me to simulate multiple light bounces efficiently, contributing to soft shadows, indirect lighting, and realistic global illumination throughout the scene.</p>

			<p>As evident, the bunny with indirect illumination is a lot less well lit than the direct illumination bunny, because it only captures light that has bounced off other surfaces, not the direct light coming straight from the light source. The Global bunny is the brightest of them all, as expected.</p>

			<p>In the non-accumulated renders of <code>CBbunny.dae</code>, I was able to observe the isolated contributions of each individual bounce of light. At the second bounce, I noticed subtle illumination on areas of the bunny that were previously in shadow—such as underneath the chin or between the legs. This illumination came from light that first hit the floor or walls and then bounced onto the bunny. Since the first bounce only includes direct light, these areas would remain completely dark without the second bounce. At the third bounce, I started to see a faint glow throughout the scene, spread almost uniformly. The bunny is barely noticable by this bounce.</p>
			<p>When I enabled bounce accumulation, the visual results improved significantly with each added bounce. At zero bounces, the render only displayed emissive surfaces, since no light had yet reflected onto the scene. At one bounce, I began to see the bunny and walls where they were directly lit by the light source, but the shadows were extremely dark and lacked any softness. By the second bounce, I noticed a clear improvement in shadow softness and subtle illumination in areas not directly hit by the light. Interestingly, I also began to see color bleeding—such from the red wall onto the white bunny. At three or more bounces, the scene grew brighter, and more fine details became visible, but each additional bounce only resulted in hard-to-notice differences.</p>
			<p>While implementing Russian Roulette, I used a termination probability of 0.35.</p>

		<h2>Part 5: Adaptive Sampling</h2>
		<p>adaptive sampling is a technique used to dynamically determine how many rays (or samples) are needed per pixel, based on the variance in color values of the samples collected so far. Instead of using a fixed number of samples for every pixel, adaptive sampling stops early when the estimated pixel color has converged—that is, when additional samples are unlikely to significantly change the result. This allows the renderer to save computation time by allocating more samples only where they’re needed.</p>
		<p>In my implementation, for each pixel, I generate a ray within the pixel using <code>gridSampler->get_sample()</code>, then trace it through the scene using <code>est_radiance_global_illumination</code>. I accumulate the returned radiance in rvl to compute the average color, while also updating s and s2, which store the sum and sum of squares of the radiance's illuminance. To enable adaptive sampling, I evaluate convergence every <code>samplesPerBatch</code> samples. At each checkpoint, I calculate the mean, variance, and the confidence interval using the 95% confidence level multiplier (1.96²). If this confidence interval is smaller than a threshold based on the mean squared illuminance, I conclude that the sample variance is low enough and stop taking more samples for that pixel. This means the color is stable and doesn't require further refinement. Finally, I average the collected radiance values and write the result to the framebuffer.</p>
