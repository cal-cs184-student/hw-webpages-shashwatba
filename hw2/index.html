		<h2>Overview</h2>
		Through this assignment, I learned about Bezier curves and surfaces along with the loop subdivision algorithm, including edge flips and splits. These were very fun to implement, because they involved a lot of computation and visualization planning before implementing the code. In particular, the practice with the extra credit portions helped me internalize the different components of the triangle mesh structure, making note of nuances such as boundary edges.
		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
		<p>De Casteljau's algorithm is a recursive algorithm that allows us to construct Bezier curves using their control points. 
		The algorithm works by recursively evaluating points somewhere between each pair of control points (where the line division ratio is \(t:(1-t)\)) until we are left with only one point. 
		The intermediate points calculated are the control points of the new Bezier curve. To implement it, I simply looped through all neighbouring points and evaluated their weighted average according to \(t\) and \((1-t)\) at each step of the proceses, storing them in a vector2D array of the original length minus one.</p>

		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
		
		<p>De Casteljau's algorithm extends naturally to Bézier surfaces by first applying it to each row of control points. This process reduces each row to a single point, which then serves as the control points for a new Bézier curve. The algorithm is subsequently applied to these remaining points to determine a final singular point.
		To implement this, the core <code>evaluateStep()</code> function was really similar to part one. I then wrote the code to call <code>evaluateStep()</code> repeatedly until 
	the size of the input points was one. Lastly, I wrote an algorithm to first evaluate the control points row-by-row, with <code>u</code> as the input parameter, and then evaluate the resulting points a single time with parameter <code>v</code>.</p>

		<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
		<p>To implement area-weighted vertex normals, I iterated through all the half-edges connected to the current vertex until completing a full loop. For each half-edge, I retrieved the three vertex positions defining its associated face and computed the cross product of two edge vectors. I then accumulated the result by adding half the norm of this cross product to the running sum. Finally, I normalized the accumulated vector using <code>.unit()</code> to obtain the final vertex normal.</p>

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
		<p>I found that the best way to implement edge flips was simply drawing out the two triangles before and after the edge split and assign edges, vertices, facese and halfedges to what they should be pointing to. The halfedges were the trickiest because half of them are on boundary edges, meaning the only way to get their corresponding facee is calling <code>->face()</code> and I had to directly call <code>->next()</code> to find out their invisible next edge. For debugging, I ended up just staring at my code really hard to ensure the cyclic patterns existed and made sense as per my drawing.</p>

		<h3>Part 5: Edge split (with extra credit: boundary splits)</h3>
		<p>Implementing edge splits was similar to edge flips, except I had to be more careful. I drew out the diagrams before and after the split, and realized that I needed to create two new edges, along with their corresponding half-edges/twins, one vertex, and two new faces. I arbitrarily chose <code>e0</code> to remain as the top-center edge in the diagram, along with some other arbitrary naming decisions. While creating new objects, I initialized them using the <code>new[Name]</code> functions, then calculated their attributes using my diagram. <code>m</code>'s position was the midpoint of <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>'s.
		</p>

		<p>For debugging, I mostly found staring at my code helpful, and leaving and coming back to it in a while. I tried the check_for functions and noticed that some vertices had 7 half edges pointing to them, while others only had 6. The bug turned out to be coming from me being lazy and not writing down half-edge names on my diagram (and consequently miscalculating <code>h7</code>'s twin to be <code>h7</code> instead of <code>h7t</code>) in one line.</p>
		
		<p>For the extra credit, I again drew out the diagram and coded it out. By now, I was confident and only made one error, getting the boundary split to work on the second try. The algorithm was very similar to the normal split case, except we only add one new edge (and corresponding vertex <code>m</code> with half-edges). The key insight was that there were two cases: either <code>e0->halfedge()</code> was the boundary half-edge, or its twin. One of the cases can be collapsed onto the other one without loss of generality by rotating the diagram 180 degrees, and noting which variables need to be swapped (these turn out to be the two boundary vertices along with h0 and h0t). The rest of the implementation was trivial.</p>

		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling (with extra credit: meshes with boundaries and the modified butterfly scheme)</h3>
		<p>To implement loop subdivision, I followed the recommended "reverse" order listed in the spec, since coarser meshes are easier to navigate. I first computed the <code>newPosition</code>s of the original vertices, along with the positions of the new midpoint vertices, storing the latter in the edge's <code>newPosition</code>. Then, I split only the original edges by iterating through a previously-cached <code>vector<EdgeIter></code> array and updating the new vertices' position. Lastly, I flipped all edges where the two connected vertices have different <code>isNew</code> values, and updated the previously computed vector <code>newPosition</code>s</EdgeIter></code>. In the process of implementation, I also wrote a <code>computeCentroid()</code> function even though the comments said I don't need to do this.</p>

		<p>Due to the averaging nature of upsampling, bumps and uneven/jagged regions are mitigated after applying it. Bevels are smoothened out as well.</p>

			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

		</div>

		<p>Sharp corners and edges become extremely smooth and distant from their original positions after repeated subdivision loops because of how vertex positions are averaged on each iteration, and the corner vertices are the only vertices, far apart from each other. To avoid this, we can split the edges neighboring a corner vertex preemptively, resulting in a protruding corner after the loop subdivision instead of a well-rounded region.</p>

		<p>Yes, it is possible to make cube.dae symmetric after loop subdivisions using splits and a few flips. This produces something closer to a cube with rounded edges, which is symmetric because increasing the number of vertices and edges allowed for more uniforly distributed loop subdivisions, whereas having only a few objects to run the algorithm on leads to more subdivisions in certain areas, leaving behind protrusions where the initial edges were.</p>

		<p>For extra credit, I handled supporting meshes with boundaries by making modifications to my handling of boundary vertices and edges in steps one and two. For each old boundary vertex, I computed the new position as \( \frac{3}{4}v + \frac{1}{8}(v_1+v_2)\), where \(v1\) and \(v2\) are the neighboring boundary vertices. Next, when splitting a boundary edge, I chose the new vertex to have a position that is the weighted average of its neighbors. Lastly, I made sure I never flip boundary edges in the fourth step. The paper linked on the spec linked to another paper [BLZ00] which had these formulae. There was also some other literature on the internet with the same formulae: I learned that "even" vertices are pre-existing ones, and "odd" vertices are the new ones brought about by loop subdivision.</p>

		<p>For more extra credit, I implemented the modified butterfly scheme using the method in the paper listed on the spec. Only steps one and two required modification. For step one, I simply assigned each original edge it's original weight, since in this algorithm we are only modifying the positions of new edges.</p>
		
		<p>Step two was more involved. Firstly, for boundary edges, I used a pattern of iterating through the two halfedge's <code>->twin()->next()</code> until I found their neighbouring boundary vertices, for a total of four boundary vertices. Then I weighted them as per the paper. For the double ordinary case, I resorted, yet again, to drawing out the diagram to navigate halfedges until I have assigned all 10 vertices neighbouring our two. Then, I assigned weights.</p>

		<p>For the one ordinary, one extraordinary case, I assigned labels \(q\) and \(s0\) as per the diagram, where \(q\) is the vertex with a valence not equal to six. This vertex gets weight \(\frac{3}{4}\) in the final position of the midpoint. The other vertices, starting from <code>s0</code>, and again, navigating in a <code>->next()->twin()->next()</code> pattern, get weights as per the guidelines. The cases of valence three and four required special attention (hardcoding the values that didn't follow the cosine pattern).</p>

		<p>Lastly, the case of double extraordinary was similar to the one ordinary, one extraordinary case, except we don't have an ordinary vertex anymore and so need to treat both as extraordinary. Choosing \(q\) and \(s0\) is initially arbitrary, and we must repeat the proceess again after swapping them. A mistake I made was not accounting for the three-fourth weight assigned to each vertex (\(q\) or \(s0\)) in addition to the one-fourth coming from the \(s_i\)s. Then I averaged the two.</p>

		<p>The rest of the process remained exactly the same. We split each old edge at it's midpoint, and assign it it's newly calculated position. We flip edges which connect old vertices to new ones. Lastly, we update vertex positions using the new computed ones.</p>

		<p>Here are some results of the modified Butterfly algorithm. I used <code>w = 0.0.0000001f</code> so that it is sufficiently small but not zero. The modified butterfly scheme results in more irregular meshes than the loop subdivisions scheme, perhaps because of how it handles vertices very differently based on their degree. The algorithm notably looses smoothness, resulting in more irregular, perhaps more realistic, meshes.</p>

		<h2>Section III: Potential Extra Credit - Art Competition: Model something Creative</h2>
		<p>I created a clam by extruding a circle with 24 edges, subdividing it using Catmull-Clark (Blender's version of it), plotting a Bezier curve and then mapping the cylinder through that. I also threw in a 360 degree rotation somewhere in there before mapping it to the Bezier curve, leading to a denser mesh. I was initially trying to model a candy cane using my Bezier curve, but that model could not survive conversion to a .dae file.</p>
